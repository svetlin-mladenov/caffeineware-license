# Caffeineware License

    "THE CAFFEINE-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 2):
    <[email]> wrote this code.  As long as you retain this notice you
    can do whatever you want with this stuff. If we meet some day, and you think
    this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a caffeine-containing
    drink (like a cup of coffee or black tea) in return.   [name]

## Why?

I prefer coffee or tea to beer. Not that beer is bad :)

## Camparison to [beerware license][1]

It is the same but with the word `beer` replaced by `caffeine-containing drink`.

## Comparison to [coffeeware license][2]

Caffeineware License is not limited to just coffee but also includes other caffeine-containing drinks like tea, mate and so on.
