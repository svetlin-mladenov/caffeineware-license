# Caffeineware License

    "THE CAFFEINE-WARE LICENSE" (Revision 3):
    <[email]> created this stuff. You can do whatever you want with it.
    If we meet some day, and you think this stuff is worth it,
    you can buy me a caffeine-containing drink
    (like a cup of coffee or black tea) in return.   [name]

## Why?

I prefer coffee or tea to beer. Not that beer is bad :)

## Camparison to [beerware license][1]

Revisions 1 and 2 are the identical to beerware license but with the word `beer` replaced by `caffeine-containing drink`.

Revision 3 removes the requirement to retains the license notice.

## Comparison to [coffeeware license][2]

Caffeineware License does not contain the parts about `social networks` and `donating` because I find them too pushy.

Also Caffeineware License is not limited to just coffee but also includes other caffeine-containing drinks like tea, mate and so on.
